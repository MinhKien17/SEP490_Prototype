# EvidencePilot BE API Flows and Routes

This document maps the current Spring Boot backend API surface to the feature flows implemented in code.

Scope and assumptions:

- Base URL is whatever hosts this service, usually `http://localhost:8080`.
- All application API routes are under `/api` except Swagger/OpenAPI routes.
- Public routes are `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `GET /api/auth/verify-email`, `GET /api/health`, `/v3/api-docs/**`, `/swagger-ui/**`, and `/ws/**`.
- All other routes require `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.
- Role and ownership checks are split between `SecurityConfig`, `@PreAuthorize`, and `CurrentUserService`.
- MySQL is the relational source of truth. Qdrant is the vector search index for extracted source chunks.
- External AI calls go through `AiModelClient` to the single configured `AI_MODEL_BASE_URL`.

## Security and Access Model

Global web security:

| Route pattern | Access |
| --- | --- |
| `OPTIONS /**` | Public |
| `/api/auth/login` | Public |
| `/api/auth/register` | Public |
| `/api/auth/verify-email` | Public |
| `/api/health` | Public |
| `/error` | Public |
| `/v3/api-docs/**`, `/swagger-ui/**`, `/swagger-ui.html` | Public |
| `/ws`, `/ws/**` | Public |
| `/api/auth/update-password` | Authenticated |
| `/api/users/profile` | Authenticated |
| `/api/users/**` | `ADMIN` |
| Everything else | Authenticated |

JWT flow:

1. Login returns a JWT containing email and role.
2. `JwtAuthenticationFilter` reads `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
3. If valid, it puts the email principal and `ROLE_<role>` authority into Spring Security.
4. Controllers and services load the real `User` from MySQL by email when they need ownership checks.

Ownership rules used by `CurrentUserService`:

| Resource | Access rule |
| --- | --- |
| User profile | Current authenticated user can access `/api/users/profile`; admin can manage `/api/users/**`. |
| Project | Admin can access any. Student can access owned projects. Instructor can read projects in `IN_REVIEW` when assigned by a feedback request. |
| Project writes | Admin can write. Student owner can write unless the project is `IN_REVIEW`. Instructor cannot write student project content. |
| Collection | Access follows collection ownership rules. |
| Source/document | Access follows project, collection, or uploader ownership. |
| Claim | Access follows the claim's project. |
| Paper | Access follows the paper's project. |
| Feedback request | Admin can access any. Instructor can act on assigned requests. Student can see own requests in list flow. |

## Feature Flow Details

## 1. Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant AuthController
    participant UserRepository
    participant PasswordEncoder
    participant JwtUtil
    participant MySQL

    Client->>AuthController: POST /api/auth/register
    AuthController->>UserRepository: existsByEmail(email)
    AuthController->>PasswordEncoder: encode(password)
    AuthController->>MySQL: save User
    AuthController-->>Client: message, email, role

    Client->>AuthController: POST /api/auth/login
    AuthController->>UserRepository: findByEmail(email)
    AuthController->>PasswordEncoder: matches(raw, hash)
    AuthController->>JwtUtil: generateToken(email, role)
    AuthController-->>Client: AuthResponse(token, email, role)
```

Explanation:

- Register is public and creates a `users` row.
- Duplicate email returns `409 Conflict`.
- Login returns `401 Unauthorized` for missing user or wrong password to avoid user enumeration.
- JWT expiration is configured by `JWT_EXPIRATION_MS`, default 24 hours.
- Password update requires an authenticated user, verifies `oldPassword`, then stores only the new BCrypt hash.

## 2. User Profile and Admin User Management Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Token["Bearer token"] --> Me["GET/PUT /api/users/profile"]
    Me --> Current["Load current user by SecurityContext email"]
    Current --> UserRepo["UserRepository"]
    UserRepo --> UserDto["Return UserDto without password hash"]

    Admin["Admin token"] --> AdminRoutes["GET /api/users/{id}"]
    AdminRoutes --> AdminOps["Read user profile by ID"]
```

Explanation:

- `/api/users/profile` is self-service and only exposes `UserResponse`.
- `PUT /api/users/profile` accepts profile update fields; role, email, and password are not changed here.
- `/api/users/**` is globally restricted to `ADMIN` in `SecurityConfig`.
- The current controller only exposes `GET /api/users/{id}` plus the profile self-service routes.

## 3. Student Project Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Student["Student JWT"] --> ProjectController["ProjectController"]
    ProjectController --> CurrentUser["CurrentUserService.requireCurrentUser"]
    CurrentUser --> ProjectService["ProjectServiceImpl"]
    ProjectService --> ProjectRepo["ProjectRepository tenant-safe finders"]
    ProjectRepo --> MySQL["projects table"]
```

Explanation:

- Project CRUD is student-owned.
- Create ignores client-supplied student/status/active fields; owner is read from JWT context.
- Reads use active, student-scoped repository methods.
- Delete is soft-delete: `active=false`, `status=DELETED`.
- Project source routes use `SourceQueryServiceImpl` and `CurrentUserService` to allow admins, owning students, and assigned instructors during review.

## 4. Collection Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Instructor["Instructor or Admin JWT"] --> CollectionController
    CollectionController --> CollectionService
    CollectionService --> MySQL["collections table"]
    SourceUpload["POST /api/sources with collectionId"] --> DocumentService
    DocumentService --> Access["requireCollectionAccess"]
    DocumentService --> Queue["SourceExtractionService.triggerExtraction"]
```

Explanation:

- `DatasetController` is not present in the current backend.
- Instructor evidence libraries are represented by `CollectionController` and collection-scoped source documents.
- Source upload accepts optional `collectionId`; access is checked with `CurrentUserService.requireCollectionAccess`.

## 5. Source Upload, Extraction, Chunking, Embedding, and Indexing Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant SourceController
    participant DocumentService
    participant MinIO
    participant ExtractionQueue
    participant Worker
    participant MySQL

    Client->>SourceController: POST /api/sources multipart file
    SourceController->>DocumentService: uploadDocument(projectId, collectionId, file, SOURCE)
    DocumentService->>DocumentService: Check project/collection/uploader access
    DocumentService->>MySQL: Save Document metadata
    DocumentService->>MinIO: Upload raw object under sources/raw/{documentId}
    DocumentService->>ExtractionQueue: triggerExtraction(documentId)
    Worker->>MySQL: Save extracted text and chunks
    Worker->>Worker: Generate dense and sparse vectors
    Worker->>MySQL: Mark processing status
    SourceController-->>Client: DocumentResponse
```

Explanation:

- `SourceController` can attach a source to a project, a collection, or only the uploader.
- `DocumentController` also exposes `POST /api/documents`, which uploads a source document with optional `projectId`.
- Raw files are stored in MinIO bucket `evidence-pilot-bucket`; MySQL remains the metadata and text source of truth.
- Extraction is asynchronous through `SourceExtractionService.triggerExtraction`.

## 6. Paper Upload and Paper Review Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Upload["POST /api/papers"] --> Access["requireProjectAccess"]
    Access --> DocumentService["DocumentService.uploadDocument(..., PAPER)"]
    DocumentService --> Queue["Queue extraction"]
    DocumentService --> Sections["PaperProcessingService.detectAndPersistSections"]
    Sections --> Review["POST /api/papers/{id}/reviews"]
    Review --> AI["PaperProcessingService.review"]
    AI --> Response["review response"]
```

Explanation:

- Paper upload is project-scoped and requires project access.
- Paper upload uses the shared `DocumentService` path with `DocumentType.PAPER`.
- `PaperProcessingService.detectAndPersistSections` runs after upload.
- Review is exposed as `POST /api/papers/{id}/reviews` and accepts optional `targetStyle`.

## 7. Claim CRUD, Suggestions, and Evaluation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant ClaimController
    participant ClaimService
    participant RagController
    participant ClaimEvaluationService
    participant OllamaGateway
    participant QdrantGateway
    participant MySQL

    Client->>ClaimController: POST /api/claims
    ClaimController->>ClaimService: createClaim(request)
    ClaimService->>MySQL: Save Claim under project/section

    Client->>ClaimController: POST /api/claims/{id}/suggestions
    ClaimController->>ClaimService: createSuggestion(claim, chunk, score, explanation)
    ClaimService->>MySQL: Save pending AiSuggestion

    Client->>ClaimController: PATCH /api/claims/suggestions/{suggestionId}/status
    ClaimController->>ClaimService: updateSuggestionStatus

    Client->>RagController: POST /api/sources/{documentId}/claims/match
    RagController->>ClaimEvaluationService: evaluate(documentId, claimText)
    ClaimEvaluationService->>OllamaGateway: dense embedding and evaluation generation
    ClaimEvaluationService->>QdrantGateway: searchDocumentContext(documentId, dense, sparse, topK)
    ClaimEvaluationService-->>Client: ClaimEvaluationResponse
```

Explanation:

- Claim CRUD is project-scoped through `ClaimService`.
- AI suggestion routes are under `/api/claims/{id}/suggestions` and `/api/claims/suggestions/{suggestionId}/status`.
- Evidence lookup routes are `/api/claims/{id}/mappings` and `/api/claims/{id}/edges`.
- Claim evaluation is document-scoped through `RagController` at `/api/paper/{documentId}/claims/match` and `/api/sources/{documentId}/claims/match`.
- `ClaimEvaluationServiceImpl` gets dense embeddings from `OllamaGateway`, sparse vectors from `SparseVectorGenerator`, searches document context through `QdrantGateway`, then asks Ollama to generate the evaluation.

## 8. Feedback Review Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> ACTIVE
    ACTIVE --> IN_REVIEW: POST /api/projects/{projectId}/reviews
    IN_REVIEW --> ACTIVE: PATCH /api/feedback-requests/{id}/status?status=RETURNED
    IN_REVIEW --> ACTIVE: PATCH /api/feedback-requests/{id}/status?status=REVIEWED
    IN_REVIEW --> ACTIVE: PATCH /api/feedback-requests/{id}/status?status=REJECTED
```

Explanation:

- A student submits a project for review with an instructor ID.
- Backend verifies:
  - The project exists.
  - Caller has project write access.
  - Assigned user exists and has `INSTRUCTOR` role.
- Backend creates a `feedback_requests` row with status `PENDING`.
- Backend sets the project status to `IN_REVIEW`.
- Instructor feedback is one-to-one with a feedback request because `instructor_feedbacks.request_id` is unique.
- `PATCH /api/feedback-requests/{id}/status` sets feedback status to `RETURNED`, `REVIEWED`, or `REJECTED`, and sets the project back to `ACTIVE`.

## 9. Traceability Export Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Export["GET /api/projects/{projectId}/traceability"] --> Access["requireProjectAccess"]
    Access --> References["Load SourceReference rows"]
    Access --> Claims["Load active Claims"]
    Access --> Sources["Load active Sources"]
    Access --> Feedback["Load FeedbackRequest rows"]
    Claims --> Match["ClaimMatchingService.matchClaim top 5"]
    Claims --> Edges["Load EvidenceEdge rows"]
    References --> Response["TraceabilityExportResponse"]
    Match --> Response
    Edges --> Response
    Sources --> Response
    Feedback --> Response
```

Explanation:

- Export is project-scoped and requires project access.
- It assembles a single response containing:
  - Project ID, title, status, and export timestamp.
  - Active claims.
  - Top 5 matches per claim from current Qdrant/MySQL matching.
  - Existing `EvidenceEdge` graph data when analysis has been run.
  - Active sources with reference counts.
  - Feedback request IDs, instructor IDs, and statuses.
- Missing bibliography/export values are represented as `"MISSING"`.
- Export recomputes claim matches at request time, so results can change if Qdrant contents or source chunks change.

## Error Response Shape

`GlobalExceptionHandler` normalizes many failures into `ApiErrorResponse`.

Common mappings:

| Failure | HTTP status |
| --- | --- |
| Bean validation failure | `400 Bad Request` with field errors |
| Missing request parameter | `400 Bad Request` |
| `ResourceNotFoundException` | `404 Not Found` |
| `ResponseStatusException` | Status from exception |
| `AiValidationException` | `502 Bad Gateway` |
| Database integrity conflict | `409 Conflict` |
| Multipart upload failure | `400 Bad Request` |
